# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of Project

We were tasked to summarzie ride sharing data by city type and plot the data weekly over the first four months of 2019. We are going to share our insights with the CEO, and provide reccomendations for addressing any disparities we find.

- Impact by city type.
  - Overall, urban cities had the highest volume and lowest rate in each category while rural had the lowest volume but highest rate. Suburban was in between for each category.
  - Below is how each city ranked from highest to lowest in each category:

|Category            | Urban   | Suburban| Rural |
| -------------------|:-------:| -------:| -----:|
| Total Rides        | 1st     | 2nd     | 3rd   | 
| Total Drivers      | 1st     | 2nd     | 3rd   |
| Total Fares        | 1st     | 2nd     | 3rd   |
| Avg Fare per Ride  | 3rd     | 2nd     | 1st   |
| Avg Fare per Driver| 3rd     | 2nd     | 1st   |


### Summary

Three recomendations to the CEO:
